        This function is invoked with the feedstock as the current
        working directory.

        Implementations should make any desired changes and then "git add"
        the resulting files.

        Finally, always return three boolean values.

        The first should be True if the migration worked, False otherwise.
        The second should be True if a commit should be made, False otherwise.
        The third should be True if the migrator made any github API calls,
        False otherwise.

        By returning True for the migration working, you can mark already migrated
        feedstocks as migrated in the migrator metadata. So for example, if you
        are adding a file `.github/blah` to feedstocks, you can test for this file
        and if it is there, then return `True, False`. This marks the migration
        as done but tells the code not to make any commits (since the file is already)
        there.

        Parameters
        ----------
        feedstock : str
            The name of the feedstock without "-feedstock" (e.g., "python"
            and not "python-feedstock").
        branch : str
            Which branch of the feedstock the migrator is being called on.
